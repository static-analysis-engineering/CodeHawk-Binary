"""Script to list the strings referenced in functions.

This script lists strings that are referenced in functions to enable 
function maching between a binary and its (conjectured) source code 
(the KTAdvance C analyzer can produce a similar list for source code 
as a reference). The script prints out the strings per function and 
saves a json file in the .chu directory associated with the executable.
